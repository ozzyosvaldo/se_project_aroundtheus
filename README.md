SE_PROJECT_AROUNDTHE U.S
This project contains CSS and HTML code that allows you to see the diffrent elements/ cards that conatin diffrent places around the world. Kinda like a mini Jornal but on a website.

We created button attributes so when you hover over the Like, Plus and edit button's they change color and to be able to add javascript actions to them, this will help makes the page and buttons come to life. We also added diffrent screen @media's to be able to make the website look nice on diffrent screen sizes (Iphones, Tablets, Deasktops).
